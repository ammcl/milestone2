Structure & Skeleton
Wireframes for new site which is now viewable on mobile and desktop views.

At the top of the page the user has the options to jump to any section within the one-page site.  

The website has links to external sites which open up in a separate web-browser tabbed window.

The user can jump to a map section of South Africa which will then allow the user to click on each of the National Parks that were visited on a two week road trip.

The user can also see a sample of photos that were taken during this trip.

At the bottom of the page there is a User Story from my travel companion on her own experience of the same trip.

The final section is a contact section whereby the user can email me directly for any travel information that they may require.

Future Developement :- 
If possible to add more countries as a personal travelling spots.  Further development to include a more responsive website that will enhance the overall user experience.

All links were tested and were funtional at the time of uploading to github.
